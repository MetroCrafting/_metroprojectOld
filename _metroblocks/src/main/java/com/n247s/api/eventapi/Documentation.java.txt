CustomEventSystem (API)
----------------------------


 What is the CustomEventSystem?
 
    This is an EventHandler which acts like the ForgeHooks. Only the main difference is
    that this API gives you the possibility to create your own events, and raise them with
    a single Call. Also another big difference is that an 'ForgeHooked' method needs to be
    static, while this system allows you to add Class instances as well.(be careful! clean
    up the instances you don't use anymore, since it may decrease the performance if used
    intensively)
    
    
 How do I install it?
 
    Right now there is no way to implement it but to copy-paste the 'com' directory and its
    content into your project. Its recommended to put it into the resources directory. In the
    near future this will be available through the ForgeLib/ForgeAddon which is still in
    development right now.
    
    
 How do I use it?
 
    This is rather simple to use. just follow these steps:
    
    -step 1: create a custom EventType by extending the EventType.class.
    
    -step 2: [optional] create a custom CallHandler by extending the CallHandler.class
                or the EventApiCallHandler.class(recommended)
                
    -step 3: [optional] if you made a custom CallHandler, you need to bind it to a specific
                 EvetType.class through 'EventApi.bindCallHandler()'
                 
    -step 4: registering Class objects or Class instances to an EventType through
                'EventApi.RegisterEventListner()'. Note, a Class object can only contain static
                eventMethods! otherwise it will crash.
    
    -step 5: raise the custom event through 'EventApi.raiseEvent()'
    
    Violá, you made yourself a custom Event!
